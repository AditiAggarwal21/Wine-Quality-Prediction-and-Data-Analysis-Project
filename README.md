# Introduction
Choose a dataset suitable for a classification problem that includes at least 1,000 samples and 7 features. It can be any real-world or benchmark dataset that you have permission to access and use.
* Explain the dataset, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocess the data as needed to prepare it for modelling, discuss ethical/social issues.
* Apply classification algorithms on your chosen dataset using Python. Provide detailed explanations of your data mining processes, including the rationale behind the choice of algorithms and parameters.
* Present the results, compare the performance of the algorithms, justifying performance metrics. 
* You should critically evaluate the classification output and discuss how it will benefit the related business or help solve the problem at hand. Explain how the insights gained from the model could influence decision-making, or improve processes.
* Suggest ways the business or organization can leverage these insights to achieve specific goals or improve performance (Provide actionable recommendations)
* Evaluate and compare the results
